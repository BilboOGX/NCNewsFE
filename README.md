Welcome to the frontend repository for my interactive news sharing platform NC News https://ncnews1990.netlify.app/home.

For the backend repository visit https://github.com/BilboOGX/NCNews.

NC News is an engineered RESTful API using Express.js and PostgreSQL, applying MVC design patterns and component abstraction for optimal structure and maintainability. Developed with a React-based frontend, integrating TDD practices for robustness, responsive design and optimistic rendering for accessibility, and error handling through Express middleware and Axios to handle http requests.
