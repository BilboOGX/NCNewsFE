NC News is an interactive news sharing platform engineered with a RESTful API using Express.js and PostgreSQL, applying MVC design patterns and component abstraction for optimal structure and maintainability. Integrating TDD practices for robustness, a React-based frontend with responsive design and optimistic rendering for accessibility and error handling through Express middleware and Axios to handle http requests.
